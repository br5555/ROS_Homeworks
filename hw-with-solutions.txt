What is the location of the program that gets executed with the
roscore command?

(1 bod)

$ which roscore

Determine the sizes of the largest and smallest files located in the
same folder as roscore. Report the sizes in human-readable format
(K, MB etc.). (Hint: use options of the ls command to sort the files
by size.)

(2 boda)

$ ls -alsSh /opt/ros/indigo/bin

Find all files inside /opt/ros/indigo which are executable and
whose name begins with rqt_. Store the output in a file named
3.txt (Hint: use the find command with additional options).

(4 boda)

$ find /opt/ros/indigo -name rqt_* -executable -type f > 3.txt

In order to determine which Python programs depend on the tf
coordinate transform library, find all files inside /opt/ros/indigo
that contain the string import tf. Store the output in a file named
4.txt (Hint: use the grep command with additional option for
recursive searching)

(3 boda)

grep -r 'import tf' /opt/ros/indigo > 4.txt
